This project analyzes sales lead data to understand overall business
performance, sales effectiveness, and revenue contribution. The main
goal of this analysis is to identify areas where sales can be improved
and to highlight important business trends using a Power BI dashboard.

INSIGHTS

1. A large number of leads in the dataset are marked as "Dead".
   This shows that many potential customers are not converting into
   actual sales. It indicates the need for better follow-up, improved
   communication, and stronger lead management strategies.

2. The analysis shows that only a few clients contribute a major
   portion of the total estimated revenue. This means the business is
   highly dependent on high-value clients, and maintaining strong
   relationships with these clients is very important.

3. Sales performance is not evenly distributed among salespersons.
   A small number of salespersons are handling the highest revenue
   clients, while others contribute less. This insight can help
   management in training, performance review, and workload balancing.

4. The Pharma category has the highest number of leads compared to
   other business categories. This indicates that Pharma is the core
   business segment and should remain a key focus area for sales and
   marketing efforts.

5. Many leads remain stuck in early sales stages such as calling or
   discussion. This shows that the sales cycle is slow for some leads
   and there is an opportunity to improve lead qualification and
   faster decision-making.

ASSUMPTIONS

1. Each Inquiry No in the dataset is considered as a unique lead.

2. The estimated revenue values provided in the data are assumed to
   be accurate and consistently recorded.

3. Leads with the status "Won" are considered successful sales
   conversions.

4. Missing or blank values were cleaned, replaced, or ignored during
   the data preparation process.

5. The dataset represents sales activity for a specific time period,
   and future results may vary based on market conditions and strategy
   changes.

Overall, this dashboard helps management quickly understand sales
performance, identify problem areas, and take data-driven decisions to
improve revenue and conversion rates.
